Installing Qibo
===============

The Qibo package comes with the following modules:

* :ref:`installing-with-pip`
* :ref:`installing-from-source`

.. _installing-with-pip:

Installing with pip
-------------------

The installation using ``pip`` is the recommended approach to install Qibo.
We provide precompiled packages for linux x86/64 and macosx 10.15 or greater
for multiple Python versions.

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or greater, then
use ``pip`` to install ``qibo`` with:

.. code-block:: bash

      pip install qibo

The ``pip`` program will download and install all the required
dependencies for Qibo.

.. note::
    The ``pip`` packages for linux are compiled with CUDA support, so if your
    system has a NVIDIA GPU, Qibo will perform calculations on GPU.

.. _installing-from-source:

Installing from source
----------------------

The installation procedure presented in this section is useful in two situations:

- you need to install Qibo in an operating system and environment not supported by the ``pip`` packages (see :ref:`installing-with-pip`).

- you have to develop the code from source.

In order to install Qibo from source, you can simply clone the GitHub repository with

.. code-block::

      git clone https://github.com/Quantum-TII/qibo.git
      cd qibo

then proceed with the installation of requirements with:

.. code-block::

      pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure your system has a GNU ``g++ >= 6`` compiler. If you are working on
macosx make sure the command ``c++`` is ``clang >= 11`` and install the libomp
library with ``brew install libomp`` command.

Optionally, you can use the ``CXX`` environment variable to set then compiler
path. Similarly, the ``PYTHON`` environment variable sets the python interpreter
path.

.. note::
      If your system has a NVIDIA GPU, make sure TensorFlow is installed
      properly and runs on GPU, please refer to the `official
      documentation <https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu>`_.

      In that case, you can activate GPU support for Qibo by:

      1. installing the NVCC compiler matching the TensorFlow CUDA version, see the `CUDA documentation <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html>`_.

      2. exporting the ``CUDA_PATH`` variable with the CUDA installation path containing the cuda compiler.

      3. make sure the NVCC compiler is available from ``CUDA_PATH/bin/nvcc``, otherwise the compilation may fail. You can locate it with ``whereis nvcc`` and eventually link/copy to your ``CUDA_PATH/bin`` folder.

      For example, TensorFlow 2.3 supports CUDA 10.1. After installing
      TensorFlow proceed with the NVCC 10.1 installation. On linux the
      installation path is ``/usr/local/cuda-10.1/``.

      Before installing Qibo do ``export CUDA_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.1``.

      Note that Qibo will not enable GPU support if points 1 and 2 are not
      performed.


Then proceed with the Qibo installation using ``pip``

.. code-block::

      pip install .

or if you prefer to manually execute all installation steps:

.. code-block::

      # builds binaries
      python setup.py build

      # installs the Qibo packages
      python setup.py install # or python setup.py develop

If you prefer to keep changes always synchronized with the code then install using the develop option:

.. code-block::

      pip install -e .
      # or
      python setup.py develop

Optionally, in order to run tests and build documentation locally
you can install extra dependencies with:

.. code-block::

      pip install qibo[tests,docs]
