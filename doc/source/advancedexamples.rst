How to select hardware devices?
-------------------------------

Qibo supports execution on different hardware configurations including CPU with
multi-threading, single GPU and multiple GPUs. Here we provide some useful
information on how to control the devices that Qibo uses for circuit execution
in order to maximize performance for the available hardware configuration.

Switching between CPU and GPU
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a GPU with CUDA support is available in the system and Tensorflow is installed
for CUDA then circuits will be executed on the GPU automatically unless the user
specifies otherwise. In order to force the device a circuit will be executed
one can use:

.. code-block::  python

    with tf.device("/CPU:0"):
        # execute circuit on CPU with default initial state |000...0>.
        final_state = c()

or switch the default Qibo device using ``qibo.set_device`` as:

.. code-block::  python

    import qibo
    qibo.set_device("/CPU:0")
    final_state = c() # circuit will now be executed on CPU

The syntax of device names follows the pattern ``'/{device type}:{device number}'``
where device type can be CPU or GPU and the device number is an integer that
distinguishes multiple devices of the same type starting from 0. For more details
we refer to `Tensorflow's tutorial <https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/gpu#manual_device_placement>`_
on manual device placement.
Alternatively, running the command ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""`` in a terminal
hides GPUs from tensorflow. As a result, any program executed from the same
terminal will run on CPU even if ``tf.device`` is not used.

In most cases the GPU accelerates execution compared to CPU, however the
following limitations should be noted:
  * For small circuits (less than 10 qubits) the overhead from casting tensors
    on GPU may be larger than executing the circuit on CPU, making CPU execution
    preferrable. In such cases disabling CPU multi-threading may also increase
    performance (see next subsection).
  * A standard GPU has 12-16GB of memory and thus can simulate up to 30 qubits on
    single-precision or 29 qubits with double-precision when Qibo's default gates
    are used. For larger circuits one should either use the CPU (assuming it has
    more memory) or a distributed circuit configuration. The latter allows splitting
    the state vector on multiple devices and is useful both when multiple GPUs
    are available in the system or even for re-using a single GPU
    (see relevant subsection bellow).

Note that if the used device runs out of memory during a circuit execution an error will be
raised prompting the user to switch the default device using ``qibo.set_device``.

Setting the number of CPU threads
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Qibo by default uses the ``"custom"`` operators backend. This backend uses
OpenMP instructions for the parallelization. In most cases will utilize all
available CPU threads. For small circuits the parallelization overhead may
decrease performance making single thread execution preferrable.

You can restrict the number of threads by exporting the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS``
environment variable with the requested number of threads before launching Qibo,
or programmatically, during runtime, as follows:

.. code-block::  python

    import qibo
    # set the number of threads to 1
    qibo.set_threads(1)
    # retrieve the current number of threads
    current_threads = qibo.get_threads()

On the other hand, when using the ``"matmuleinsum"`` or ``"defaulteinsum"``
backends Qibo inherits Tensorflow's defaults for CPU thread configuration.
Tensorflow allows restricting the number of threads as follows:

.. code-block::  python

    import tensorflow as tf
    tf.config.threading.set_inter_op_parallelism_threads(1)
    tf.config.threading.set_intra_op_parallelism_threads(1)
    import qibo

Note that this should be run during Tensorflow initialization in the beginning
of the script and before any circuit or gate allocation.

Using multiple GPUs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Qibo supports distributed circuit execution on multiple GPUs. This feature can
be used as follows:

.. code-block::  python

    from qibo.models import Circuit
    from qibo import gates

    # Define GPU configuration
    accelerators = {"/GPU:0": 3, "/GPU:1": 1}
    # this will use the first GPU three times and the second one time
    # leading to four total logical devices
    # construct the distributed circuit for 32 qubits
    c = Circuit(32, accelerators, memory_device="/CPU:0")

Gates can then be added normally using ``c.add`` and the circuit can be executed
using ``c()``. Note that a ``memory_device`` is passed in the distributed circuit
(if this is not passed the CPU will be used by default). This device does not perform
any gate calculations but is used to store the full state. Therefore the
distributed simulation is limited by the amount of CPU memory.

Also, note that it is possible to reuse a single GPU multiple times increasing the number of
"logical" devices in the distributed calculation. This allows users to execute
circuits with more than 30 qubits on a single GPU by reusing several times using
``accelerators = {"/GPU:0": ndevices}``. Such a simulation will be limited
by CPU memory only.

For systems without GPUs, the distributed implementation can be used with any
type of device. For example if multiple CPUs, the user can pass these CPUs in the
accelerator dictionary.

Distributed circuits are generally slower than using a single GPU due to communication
bottleneck. However for more than 30 qubits (which do not fit in single GPU) and
specific applications (such as the QFT) the multi-GPU scheme can be faster than
using only CPU.

For more details in the distributed implementation one can look in the related
code: :class:`qibo.tensorflow.distcircuit.TensorflowDistributedCircuit`. When
``models.Circuit`` is called then this distributed implementation is used automatically
if the ``accelerators`` dictionary is passed, otherwise the standard single device
:class:`qibo.tensorflow.circuit.TensorflowCircuit` is used.

Unlike the standard circuit, executing a
:class:`qibo.tensorflow.distcircuit.TensorflowDistributedCircuit` without
measurements will return a
:class:`qibo.tensorflow.distutils.DistributedState` instead of the final
state vector as a ``tf.Tensor``. This is done because the distributed circuit
uses the state partitioned in multiple pieces that are distributed to the
different devices. Creating the full state as a tensor would require merging
these pieces and using twice as much memory. This is disabled by default,
however the user may create the full state as follows:

.. code-block::  python

    # Create distributed circuits for two GPUs
    c = Circuit(32, {"/GPU:0": 1, "/GPU:1": 1})
    # Add gates
    c.add(...)
    # Execute (``final_state`` will be a ``DistributedState``)
    final_state = c()

    # Access the full state (will double memory usage)
    full_final_state = final_state.vector
    # ``full_final_state`` is a ``tf.Tensor``

    # ``DistributedState`` supports indexing and slicing
    print(final_state[40])
    # will print the 40th component of the final state vector
    print(final_state[20:25])
    # will print the components from 20 to 24 (inclusive)


How to use callbacks?
---------------------

Callbacks allow the user to apply additional functions on the state vector
during circuit execution. An example use case of this is the calculation of
entanglement entropy as the state propagates through a circuit. This can be
implemented easily using :class:`qibo.tensorflow.callbacks.EntanglementEntropy`
and the :class:`qibo.base.gates.CallbackGate` gate. For example:

.. code-block::  python

    from qibo import models, gates, callbacks

    # create entropy callback where qubit 0 is the first subsystem
    entropy = callbacks.EntanglementEntropy([0])

    # initialize circuit with 2 qubits and add gates
    c = models.Circuit(2) # state is |00> (entropy = 0)
    c.add(gates.CallbackGate(entropy)) # performs entropy calculation in the initial state
    c.add(gates.H(0)) # state is |+0> (entropy = 0)
    c.add(gates.CallbackGate(entropy)) # performs entropy calculation after H
    c.add(gates.CNOT(0, 1)) # state is |00> + |11> (entropy = 1))
    c.add(gates.CallbackGate(entropy)) # performs entropy calculation after CNOT

    # execute the circuit using the callback
    final_state = c()

The results can be accessed using indexing on the callback objects. In this
example ``entropy[:]`` will return ``tf.Tensor([0, 0, 1])`` which are the
values of entropy after every gate in the circuit.

The same callback object can be used in a second execution of this or a different
circuit. For example

.. code-block::  python

    # c is the same circuit as above
    # execute the circuit
    final_state = c()
    # execute the circuit a second time
    final_state = c()

    # print result
    print(entropy[:]) # tf.Tensor([0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1])

The callback for entanglement entropy can also be used on state vectors directly.
For example

.. code-block::  python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import callbacks
    # create a singlet state vector
    state = np.zeros(4)
    state[0], state[3] = 1 / np.sqrt(2), 1 / np.sqrt(2)

    # create an `EntanglementEntropy` callback object
    entropy = callbacks.EntanglementEntropy([0])
    # call the object on the state
    print(entropy(state))

will print ``tf.Tensor(1.0)``.

.. _params-examples:
How to use parametrized gates?
------------------------------

Some Qibo gates such as rotations accept values for their free parameter. Once
such gates are added in a circuit their parameters can be updated using the
:meth:`qibo.base.circuit.BaseCircuit.set_parameters` method. For example:

.. code-block::  python

    from qibo.models import Circuit
    from qibo import gates
    # create a circuit with all parameters set to 0.
    c = Circuit(3)
    c.add(gates.RX(0, theta=0))
    c.add(gates.RY(1, theta=0))
    c.add(gates.CZ(1, 2))
    c.add(gates.fSim(0, 2, theta=0, phi=0))
    c.add(gates.H(2))

    # set new values to the circuit's parameters
    params = [0.123, 0.456, (0.789, 0.321)]
    c.set_parameters(params)

initializes a circuit with all gate parameters set to 0 and then updates the
values of these parameters according to the ``params`` list. Alternatively the
user can use ``circuit.set_parameters()`` with a dictionary or a flat list.
The keys of the dictionary should be references to the gate objects of
the circuit. For example:

.. code-block::  python

    c = Circuit(3)
    g0 = gates.RX(0, theta=0)
    g1 = gates.RY(1, theta=0)
    g2 = gates.fSim(0, 2, theta=0, phi=0)
    c.add([g0, g1, gates.CZ(1, 2), g2, gates.H(2)])

    # set new values to the circuit's parameters using a dictionary
    params = {g0: 0.123, g1: 0.456, g2: (0.789, 0.321)}
    c.set_parameters(params)
    # equivalently the parameter's can be update with a list as
    params = [0.123, 0.456, (0.789, 0.321)]
    c.set_parameters(params)
    # or with a flat list as
    params = [0.123, 0.456, 0.789, 0.321]
    c.set_parameters(params)

If a list is given then its length and elements should be compatible with the
parametrized gates contained in the circuit. If a dictionary is given then its
keys should be all the parametrized gates in the circuit.

The following gates support parameter setting:

* ``RX``, ``RY``, ``RZ``, ``U1``, ``CU1``: Accept a single ``theta`` parameter.
* :class:`qibo.base.gates.fSim`: Accepts a tuple of two parameters ``(theta, phi)``.
* :class:`qibo.base.gates.GeneralizedfSim`: Accepts a tuple of two parameters
  ``(unitary, phi)``. Here ``unitary`` should be a unitary matrix given as an
  array or ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(2, 2)``.
* :class:`qibo.base.gates.Unitary`: Accepts a single ``unitary`` parameter. This
  should be an array or ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(2, 2)``.
* :class:`qibo.base.gates.VariationalLayer`: Accepts a list of ``float``
  parameters with length compatible to the number of one qubit rotations implemented
  by the layer, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo.models import Circuit
    from qibo import gates

    nqubits = 5
    c = Circuit(nqubits)
    pairs = [(i, i + 1) for i in range(0, 4, 2)]
    c.add(gates.VariationalLayer(range(nqubits), pairs,
                                 gates.RY, gates.CZ,
                                 params=np.zeros(5)))
    c.add((gates.RX(i, theta=0) for i in range(5)))

    # set random parameters to all rotations in the circuit
    c.set_parameters(np.random.random(10))
    # note that 10 numbers are used as the VariationalLayer contains five
    # rotations and five additional RX rotations are added afterwards.

Note that a ``np.ndarray`` or a ``tf.Tensor`` may also be used in the place of
a flat list.

Using :meth:`qibo.base.circuit.BaseCircuit.set_parameters` is more efficient than
recreating a new circuit with new parameter values.


How to invert a circuit?
------------------------

Many quantum algorithms require using a specific subroutine and its inverse
in the same circuit. Qibo simplifies this implementation via the
:meth:`qibo.base.circuit.BaseCircuit.invert` method. This method produces
the inverse of a circuit by taking the dagger of all gates in reverse order. It
can be used with circuit addition to simplify the construction of algorithms,
for example:

.. code-block:: python

    from qibo.models import Circuit
    from qibo import gates

    # Create a subroutine
    subroutine = Circuit(6)
    subroutine.add([gates.RX(i, theta=0.1) for i in range(5)])
    subroutine.add([gates.CZ(i, i + 1) for i in range(0, 5, 2)])

    # Create the middle part of the circuit
    middle = Circuit(6)
    middle.add([gates.CU2(i, i + 1, phi=0.1, lam=0.2) for i in range(0, 5, 2)])

    # Create the total circuit as subroutine + middle + subroutine^{-1}
    circuit = subroutine + middle + subroutine.invert()


Note that circuit addition works only between circuits that act on the same number
of qubits. It is often useful to add subroutines only on a subset of qubits of the
large circuit. This is possible using the :meth:`qibo.base.circuit.BaseCircuit.on_qubits`
method. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    from qibo import models, gates

    # Create a small circuit of 4 qubits
    smallc = models.Circuit(4)
    smallc.add((gates.RX(i, theta=0.1) for i in range(4)))
    smallc.add((gates.CNOT(0, 1), gates.CNOT(2, 3)))

    # Create a large circuit on 8 qubits
    largec = models.Circuit(8)
    # Add the small circuit on even qubits
    largec.add(smallc.on_qubits(*range(0, 8, 2)))
    # Add a QFT on odd qubits
    largec.add(models.QFT(4).on_qubits(*range(1, 8, 2)))
    # Add an inverse QFT on first 6 qubits
    largec.add(models.QFT(6).invert().on_qubits(*range(6)))


.. _vqe-example:

How to write a VQE?
-------------------

The VQE requires an ansatz function and a ``Hamiltonian`` object.
There are examples of VQE optimization in ``examples/benchmarks``:

    - ``vqe.py``: a simple example with the XXZ model.

Here is a simple example using the Heisenberg XXZ model Hamiltonian:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import models, gates, hamiltonians

    nqubits = 6
    nlayers  = 4

    # Create variational circuit
    circuit = models.Circuit(nqubits)
    for l in range(nlayers):
        circuit.add((gates.RY(q, theta=0) for q in range(nqubits)))
        circuit.add((gates.CZ(q, q+1) for q in range(0, nqubits-1, 2)))
        circuit.add((gates.RY(q, theta=0) for q in range(nqubits)))
        circuit.add((gates.CZ(q, q+1) for q in range(1, nqubits-2, 2)))
        circuit.add(gates.CZ(0, nqubits-1))
    circuit.add((gates.RY(q, theta=0) for q in range(nqubits)))

    # Create XXZ Hamiltonian
    hamiltonian = hamiltonians.XXZ(nqubits=nqubits)
    # Create VQE model
    vqe = models.VQE(circuit, hamiltonian)

    # Optimize starting from a random guess for the variational parameters
    initial_parameters = np.random.uniform(0, 2*np.pi,
                                            2*nqubits*nlayers + nqubits)
    best, params = vqe.minimize(initial_parameters, method='BFGS', compile=False)


For more information on the available options of the ``vqe.minimize`` call we
refer to the :ref:`Optimizers <Optimizers>` section of the documentation.
Note that if the Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer is used then the user
has to use a backend based on tensorflow primitives and not the default custom
backend, as custom operators currently do not support automatic differentiation.
To switch the backend one can do ``qibo.set_backend("matmuleinsum")``.
Check the :ref:`How to use automatic differentiation? <autodiff-example>`
section for more details.

A useful gate for defining the ansatz of the VQE is :class:`qibo.base.gates.VariationalLayer`.
This optimizes performance by fusing the layer of one-qubit parametrized gates with
the layer of two-qubit entangling gates and applying both as a single layer of
general two-qubit gates (as 4x4 matrices). The ansatz from the above example can
be written using :class:`qibo.base.gates.VariationalLayer` as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    circuit = models.Circuit(nqubits)
    pairs = [(i, i + 1) for i in range(0, nqubits - 1, 2)]
    theta = np.zeros(nqubits)
    for l in range(nlayers):
        circuit.add(gates.VariationalLayer(range(nqubits), pairs,
                                           gates.RY, gates.CZ,
                                           theta, theta))
        circuit.add((gates.CZ(i, i + 1) for i in range(1, nqubits - 2, 2)))
        circuit.add(gates.CZ(0, nqubits - 1))
    circuit.add((gates.RY(i, theta) for i in range(nqubits)))


.. _qaoa-example:

How to use the QAOA?
--------------------

The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) was introduced in
`arXiv:1411.4028 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028>`_ and is a prominent
algorithm for solving hard optimization problems using the circuit-based model
of quantum computation. Qibo provides an implementation of the QAOA as a model
that can be defined using a :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.Hamiltonian`. When
properly optimized, the QAOA ansatz will approximate the ground state of this
Hamiltonian. Here is a simple example using the Heisenberg XXZ Hamiltonian:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import models, hamiltonians

    # Create XXZ Hamiltonian for six qubits
    hamiltonian = hamiltonians.XXZ(6)
    # Create QAOA model
    qaoa = models.QAOA(hamiltonian)

    # Optimize starting from a random guess for the variational parameters
    initial_parameters = 0.01 * np.random.uniform(0,1,4)
    best_energy, final_parameters = qaoa.minimize(initial_parameters, method="BFGS")

In the above example the initial guess for parameters has length four and
therefore the QAOA ansatz consists of four operators, two using the
``hamiltonian`` and two using the mixer Hamiltonian. The user may specify the
mixer Hamiltonian when defining the QAOA model, otherwise
:class:`qibo.hamiltonians.X` will be used by default.
Note that the user may set the values of the variational parameters explicitly
using :meth:`qibo.models.QAOA.set_parameters`.
Similarly to the VQE, we refer to :ref:`Optimizers <Optimizers>` for more
information on the available options of the ``qaoa.minimize``.

QAOA uses the |++...+> as the default initial state on which the variational
operators are applied. The user may specify a different initial state when
executing or optimizing by passing the ``initial_state`` argument.

The QAOA model uses :ref:`Solvers <Solvers>` to apply the exponential operators
to the state vector. For more information on how solvers work we refer to the
:ref:`How to simulate time evolution? <timeevol-example>` section.
When a :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.Hamiltonian` is used then solvers will
exponentiate it using its full matrix. Alternatively, if a
:class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian` is used then solvers
will fall back to traditional Qibo circuits that perform Trotter steps. For
more information on how the Trotter decomposition is implemented in Qibo we
refer to the :ref:`Using Trotter decomposition <trotterdecomp-example>` example.

When Trotter decomposition is used, it is possible to execute the QAOA circuit
on multiple devices, by passing an ``accelerators`` dictionary when defining
the model. For example the previous example would have to be modified as:

.. code-block:: python

    from qibo import models, hamiltonians

    hamiltonian = hamiltonians.XXZ(6, trotter=True)
    qaoa = models.QAOA(hamiltonian, accelerators={"/GPU:0": 1, "/GPU:1": 1})


.. _autodiff-example:

How to use automatic differentiation?
-------------------------------------

As a deep learning framework, Tensorflow supports
`automatic differentiation <https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/customization/autodiff>`_.
This can be used to optimize the parameters of variational circuits. For example
the following script optimizes the parameters of two rotations so that the circuit
output matches a target state using the fidelity as the corresponding loss
function.

.. code-block:: python

    # switch backend to "matmuleinsum" or "defaulteinsum"
    import qibo
    qibo.set_backend("matmuleinsum")
    import tensorflow as tf
    from qibo import gates, models

    # Optimization parameters
    nepochs = 1000
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
    target_state = tf.ones(4, dtype=tf.complex128) / 2.0

    # Define circuit ansatz
    params = tf.Variable(tf.random.uniform((2,), dtype=tf.float64))
    c = models.Circuit(2)
    c.add(gates.RX(0, params[0]))
    c.add(gates.RY(1, params[1]))

    for _ in range(nepochs):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            c.set_parameters(params)
            fidelity = tf.math.abs(tf.reduce_sum(tf.math.conj(target_state) * c()))
            loss = 1 - fidelity
        grads = tape.gradient(loss, params)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip([grads], [params]))


Note that a backend that uses tensorflow primitives gates
(either ``"matmuleinsum"`` or ``"defaulteinsum"``) has to be used because
the default ``"custom"`` backend does not support automatic differentiation.

The optimization procedure may also be compiled, however in this case it is not
possible to use :meth:`qibo.base.circuit.BaseCircuit.set_parameters` as the
circuit needs to be defined inside the compiled ``tf.GradientTape()``.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    import qibo
    qibo.set_backend("matmuleinsum")
    import tensorflow as tf
    from qibo import gates, models

    nepochs = 1000
    params = tf.Variable(tf.random.uniform((2,), dtype=tf.float64))
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
    target_state = tf.ones(4, dtype=tf.complex128) / 2.0
    params = tf.Variable(tf.random.uniform((2,), dtype=tf.float64))


    @tf.function
    def optimize(params):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            c = models.Circuit(2)
            c.add(gates.RX(0, theta=params[0]))
            c.add(gates.RY(1, theta=params[1]))
            fidelity = tf.math.abs(tf.reduce_sum(tf.math.conj(target_state) * c()))
            loss = 1 - fidelity
        grads = tape.gradient(loss, params)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip([grads], [params]))


    for _ in range(nepochs):
        optimize(params)


The user may also use ``tf.Variable`` and parametrized gates in any other way
that is supported by Tensorflow, such as defining
`custom Keras layers <https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_layers_and_models>`_
and using the `Sequential model API <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential>`_
to train them.


.. _noisy-example:

How to perform noisy simulation?
--------------------------------

Qibo can perform noisy simulation with two different methods: by repeating the
circuit execution multiple times and applying noise gates probabilistically
or by using density matrices and applying noise channels. The two methods
are analyzed in the following sections.

Moreover, Qibo provides functionality to add bit-flip errors to measurements
after the simulation is completed. This is analyzed in
:ref:`Measurement errors <measurementbitflips-example>`.



.. _densitymatrix-example:

Using density matrices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Qibo circuits can evolve density matrices if they are initialized using the
``density_matrix=True`` flag, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    from qibo import models, gates

    # Define circuit
    c = models.Circuit(2, density_matrix=True)
    c.add(gates.H(0))
    c.add(gates.H(1))
    # execute using the default initial state |00><00|
    final_rho = c()
    # final_rho will be tf.ones(4) / 4 which corresponds to |++><++|

will perform the transformation

.. math::
    |00 \rangle \langle 00| \rightarrow (H_1 \otimes H_2)|00 \rangle \langle 00|(H_1 \otimes H_2)^\dagger = |++ \rangle \langle ++|

Similarly to state vector circuit simulation, the user may specify a custom
initial density matrix by passing the corresponding array when executing the
circuit. If a state vector is passed as an initial state in a density matrix
circuit, it will be transformed automatically to the equivalent density matrix.

Additionally, Qibo provides several gates that represent channels which can
be used during a density matrix simulation. We refer to the
:ref:`Channels <Channels>` section of the documentation for a complete list of
the available channels. Noise can be simulated using these channels,
for example:

.. code-block:: python

    from qibo import models, gates

    c = models.Circuit(2, density_matrix=True) # starts with state |00><00|
    c.add(gates.X(1))
    # transforms |00><00| -> |01><01|
    c.add(gates.PauliNoiseChannel(0, px=0.3))
    # transforms |01><01| -> (1 - px)|01><01| + px |11><11|
    final_state = c()
    # will return tf.Tensor(diag([0, 0.7, 0, 0.3]))

will perform the transformation

.. math::
    |00\rangle \langle 00|& \rightarrow (I \otimes X)|00\rangle \langle 00|(I \otimes X)
    = |01\rangle \langle 01|
    \\& \rightarrow 0.7|01\rangle \langle 01| + 0.3(X\otimes I)|01\rangle \langle 01|(X\otimes I)^\dagger
    \\& = 0.7|01\rangle \langle 01| + 0.3|11\rangle \langle 11|

Measurements and callbacks can be used with density matrices exactly as in the
case of state vector simulation.


.. _repeatedexec-example:

Using repeated execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simulating noise with density matrices is memory intensive as it effectively
doubles the number of qubits. Qibo provides an alternative way of simulating
the effect of channels without using density matrices, which relies on state
vectors and repeated circuit execution with sampling. Noise can be simulated
by creating a normal (non-density matrix) circuit and repeating its execution
as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import models, gates

    # Define circuit
    c = models.Circuit(5)
    thetas = np.random.random(5)
    c.add((gates.RX(i, theta=t) for i, t in enumerate(thetas)))
    # Add noise channels to all qubits
    c.add((gates.PauliNoiseChannel(i, px=0.2, py=0.0, pz=0.3)
           for i in range(5)))
    # Add measurement of all qubits
    c.add(gates.M(*range(5)))

    # Repeat execution 1000 times
    result = c(nshots=1000)

In this example the simulation is repeated 1000 times and the action of the
:class:`qibo.base.gates.PauliNoiseChannel` gate differs each time, because
the error ``X``, ``Y`` and ``Z`` gates are sampled according to the given
probabilities. Note that when a channel is used, the command ``c(nshots=1000)``
has a different behavior than what is described in
:ref:`How to perform measurements? <measurement-examples>`.
Normally ``c(nshots=1000)`` would execute the circuit once and would then
sample 1000 bit-strings from the final state. When channels are used, the full
is executed 1000 times because the behavior of channels is probabilistic and
different in each execution. Note that now the simulation time required will
increase linearly with the number of repetitions (``nshots``).

Note that executing a circuit with channels only once is possible, however,
since the channel acts probabilistically, the results of a single execution
are random and usually not useful on their own.
It is possible also to use repeated execution with noise channels even without
the presence of measurements. If ``c(nshots=1000)`` is called for a circuit
that contains channels but no measurements measurements then the circuit will
be executed 1000 times and the final 1000 state vectors will be returned as
a tensor of shape ``(nshots, 2 ^ nqubits)``.
Note that this tensor is usually large and may lead to memory errors,
therefore this usage is not advised.

Unlike the density matrix approach, it is not possible to use every channel
with sampling and repeated execution. Specifically,
:class:`qibo.base.gates.UnitaryChannel` and
:class:`qibo.base.gates.PauliNoiseChannel` can be used with sampling, while
:class:`qibo.base.gates.KrausChannel` requires density matrices.


Adding noise after every gate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In practical applications noise typically occurs after every gate.
Qibo provides the :meth:`qibo.base.circuit.BaseCircuit.with_noise()` method
which automatically creates a new circuit that contains a
:class:`qibo.base.gates.PauliNoiseChannel` after every gate.
The user can control the probabilities of the noise channel using a noise map,
which is a dictionary that maps qubits to the corresponding probability
triplets. For example, the following script

.. code-block:: python

      from qibo import models, gates

      c = models.Circuit(2)
      c.add([gates.H(0), gates.H(1), gates.CNOT(0, 1)])

      # Define a noise map that maps qubit IDs to noise probabilities
      noise_map = {0: (0.1, 0.0, 0.2), 1: (0.0, 0.2, 0.1)}
      noisy_c = c.with_noise(noise_map)

will create a new circuit ``noisy_c`` that is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: python

      noisy_c2 = models.Circuit(2)
      noisy_c2.add(gates.H(0))
      noisy_c2.add(gates.PauliNoiseChannel(0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.2))
      noisy_c2.add(gates.H(1))
      noisy_c2.add(gates.PauliNoiseChannel(1, 0.0, 0.2, 0.1))
      noisy_c2.add(gates.CNOT(0, 1))
      noisy_c2.add(gates.PauliNoiseChannel(0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.2))
      noisy_c2.add(gates.PauliNoiseChannel(1, 0.0, 0.2, 0.1))

Note that ``noisy_c`` uses the gate objects of the original circuit ``c``
(it is not a deep copy), while in ``noisy_c2`` each gate was created as
a new object.

The user may use a single tuple instead of a dictionary as the noise map
In this case the same probabilities will be applied to all qubits.
That is ``noise_map = (0.1, 0.0, 0.1)`` is equivalent to
``noise_map = {0: (0.1, 0.0, 0.1), 1: (0.1, 0.0, 0.1), ...}``.

As described in the previous sections, if
:meth:`qibo.base.circuit.BaseCircuit.with_noise()` is used in a circuit
that uses state vectors then noise will be simulated with repeated execution.
If the user wishes to use density matrices instead, this is possible by
initializing a :class:`qibo.tensorflow.circuit.TensorflowDensityMatrixCircuit`
using the ``density_matrix=True`` flag during initialization and call
``.with_noise`` on this circuit.


.. _measurementbitflips-example:

Measurement errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As described in the :ref:`How to perform measurements? <measurement-examples>`
example, simulating a circuit with measurements returns a
:class:`qibo.base.measurements.CircuitResult` object. This object provides
the :meth:`qibo.base.measurements.CircuitResult.apply_bitflips` method which
allows adding bit-flip errors to the sampled bit-strings without having to
re-execute the simulation. For example:

.. code-block:: python

      import numpy as np
      from qibo import models, gates

      thetas = np.random.random(4)
      c = models.Circuit(4)
      c.add((gates.RX(i, theta=t) for i, t in enumerate(thetas)))
      c.add([gates.M(0, 1), gates.M(2, 3)])
      result = c(nshots=100)
      # add bit-flip errors with probability 0.2 for all qubits
      noisy_result1 = result.apply_bitflips(0.2)
      # add bit-flip errors with different probabilities for each qubit
      error_map = {0: 0.2, 1: 0.1, 2: 0.3, 3: 0.1}
      noisy_result2 = result.apply_bitflips(error_map)


In this example ``noisy_result1`` and ``noisy_result2`` are new
:class:`qibo.base.measurements.CircuitResult` objects and therefore
the corresponding noisy samples and frequencies can be obtained as described
in the :ref:`How to perform measurements? <measurement-examples>` example.

Alternatively, the user may specify a bit-flip error map when defining
measurement gates:

.. code-block:: python

      import numpy as np
      from qibo import models, gates

      thetas = np.random.random(6)
      c = models.Circuit(6)
      c.add((gates.RX(i, theta=t) for i, t in enumerate(thetas)))
      c.add(gates.M(0, 1, p0=0.2))
      c.add(gates.M(2, 3, p0={2: 0.1, 3: 0.0}))
      c.add(gates.M(4, 5, p0=[0.4, 0.3]))
      result = c(nshots=100)

In this case ``result`` will contain noisy samples according to the given
bit-flip probabilities. The probabilities can be given as a
dictionary (must contain all measured qubits as keys),
a list (must have the sample as the measured qubits) or
a single float number (to be used on all measured qubits).
Note that, unlike the previous code example, when bit-flip errors are
incorporated as part of measurement gates it is not possible to access the
noiseless samples.

Moreover, it is possible to simulate asymmetric bit-flips using the ``p1``
argument as ``result.apply_bitflips(p0=0.2, p1=0.1)``. In this case a
probability of 0.2 will be used for 0->1 errors but 0.1 for 1->0 errors.
Similarly to ``p0``, ``p1`` can be a single float number or a dictionary and
can be used both in :meth:`qibo.base.measurements.CircuitResult.apply_bitflips`
and the measurement gate. If ``p1`` is not specified the value of ``p0`` will
be used for both errors.


.. _timeevol-example:

How to simulate time evolution?
-------------------------------

Simulating the unitary time evolution of quantum states is useful in many
physics applications including the simulation of adiabatic quantum computation.
Qibo provides the :class:`qibo.models.StateEvolution` model that simulates
unitary evolution using the full state vector. For example:

.. code-block::  python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import hamiltonians, models

    # Define evolution model under the non-interacting sum(Z) Hamiltonian
    # with time step dt=1e-1
    nqubits = 4
    evolve = models.StateEvolution(hamiltonians.Z(nqubits), dt=1e-1)
    # Define initial state as |++++>
    initial_state = np.ones(2 ** nqubits) / np.sqrt(2 ** nqubits)
    # Get the final state after time t=2
    final_state = evolve(final_time=2, initial_state=initial_state)


When studying dynamics people are usually interested not only in the final state
vector but also in observing how physical quantities change during the time
evolution. This is possible using callbacks. For example, in the above case we
can track how <X> changes as follows:

.. code-block::  python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import hamiltonians, models, callbacks

    nqubits = 4
    # Define a callback that calculates the energy (expectation value) of the X Hamiltonian
    observable = callbacks.Energy(hamiltonians.X(nqubits))
    # Create evolution object using the above callback and a time step of dt=1e-3
    evolve = models.StateEvolution(hamiltonians.Z(nqubits), dt=1e-3,
                                   callbacks=[observable])
    # Evolve for total time t=1
    initial_state = np.ones(2 ** nqubits) / np.sqrt(2 ** nqubits)
    final_state = evolve(final_time=1, initial_state=initial_state)

    print(observable[:])
    # will print a ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(1001,)`` that holds <X>(t) values


Note that the time step ``dt=1e-3`` defines how often we calculate <X> during
the evolution.

In the above cases the exact time evolution operator (exponential of the Hamiltonian)
was used to evolve the state vector. Because the evolution Hamiltonian is
time-independent, the matrix exponentiation happens only once. It is possible to
simulate time-dependent Hamiltonians by passing a function of time instead of
a :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.Hamiltonian` in the
:class:`qibo.models.StateEvolution` model. For example:

.. code-block::  python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import hamiltonians, models

    # Defina a time dependent Hamiltonian
    nqubits = 4
    ham = lambda t: np.cos(t) * hamiltonians.Z(nqubits)
    # and pass it to the evolution model
    evolve = models.StateEvolution(ham, dt=1e-3)
    initial_state = np.ones(2 ** nqubits) / np.sqrt(2 ** nqubits)
    final_state = evolve(final_time=1, initial_state=initial_state)


The above script will still use the exact time evolution operator with the
exponentiation repeated for each time step. The integration method can
be changed using the ``solver`` argument when executing. The solvers that are
currently implemented are the default exponential solver (``"exp"``) and two
Runge-Kutta solvers: fourth-order (``"rk4"``) and fifth-order (``"rk45"``).
For more information we refer to the :ref:`Solvers <Solvers>` section.


.. _trotterdecomp-example:

Using Trotter decomposition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Trotter decomposition provides a way to represent the unitary evolution of
quantum states as a sequence of local unitaries. This allows to represent
the physical process of time evolution as a quantum circuit. Qibo provides
functionality to perform this transformation automatically, if the underlying
Hamiltonian object is defined as a sum of commuting parts that consist of terms
that can be exponentiated efficiently.
Such Hamiltonian can be implemented in Qibo using
:class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian`.
The implementation of Trotter decmoposition is based in Sec.
4.1 of `arXiv:1901.05824 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05824>`_.
Below is an example of how to use this object in practice:

.. code-block::  python

    from qibo import hamiltonians

    # Define TFIM model as a ``TrotterHamiltonian``
    ham = hamiltonians.TFIM(nqubits=5, trotter=True)
    # This object can be used to create the circuit that
    # implements a single Trotter time step ``dt``
    circuit = ham.circuit(dt=1e-2)


This is a standard :class:`qibo.tensorflow.circuit.TensorflowCircuit` that
contains :class:`qibo.base.gates.Unitary` gates corresponding to the
exponentials of the Trotter decomposition and can be executed on any state.

Note that in the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) that was used in this
example is among the pre-coded Hamiltonians in Qibo and could be created as
a :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian` simply using the
``trotter`` flag. Defining custom Hamiltonians can be more complicated, however
Qibo simplifies this process by providing the option to define Hamiltonians
symbolically through the use of ``sympy``. For more information on this we
refer to the
:ref:`How to define custom Hamiltonians using symbols? <symbolicham-example>`
example.

A :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian` can also be used to
simulate time evolution. This can be done by passing the Hamiltonian to a
:class:`qibo.evolution.StateEvolution` model and using the exponential solver.
Qibo automatically finds that this Hamiltonian is a
:class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian` object
and uses the Trotter decomposition to perform the evolution.
For example:

.. code-block::  python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import models, hamiltonians

    nqubits = 5
    # Create a critical TFIM Hamiltonian as ``TrotterHamiltonian``
    ham = hamiltonians.TFIM(nqubits=nqubits, h=1.0, trotter=True)
    # Define the |+++++> initial state
    initial_state = np.ones(2 ** nqubits) / np.sqrt(2 ** nqubits)
    # Define the evolution model
    evolve = models.StateEvolution(ham, dt=1e-3)
    # Evolve for total time T=1
    final_state = evolve(final_time=1, initial_state=initial_state)

This script creates the Trotter circuit for ``dt=1e-3`` and applies it
repeatedly to the given initial state T / dt = 1000 times to obtain the
final state of the evolution.

Since Trotter evolution is based on Qibo circuits, it also supports distributed
execution on multiple devices (GPUs). This can be enabled by passing an
``accelerators`` dictionary when defining the
:class:`qibo.evolution.StateEvolution` model. We refer to the
:ref:`How to select hardware devices? <gpu-examples>` example for more details
on how the ``accelerators`` dictionary can be used.


How to simulate adiabatic time evolution?
-----------------------------------------

Qibo provides the :class:`qibo.models.AdiabaticEvolution` model to simulate
adiabatic time evolution. This is a special case of the
:class:`qibo.models.StateEvolution` model analyzed in the previous example
where the evolution Hamiltonian is interpolated between an initial "easy"
Hamiltonian and a "hard" Hamiltonian that usually solves an optimization problem.
Here is an example of adiabatic evolution simulation:

.. code-block::  python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import hamiltonians, models

    nqubits = 4
    T = 1 # total evolution time
    # Define the easy and hard Hamiltonians
    h0 = hamiltonians.X(nqubits)
    h1 = hamiltonians.TFIM(nqubits, h=0)
    # Define the interpolation scheduling
    s = lambda t: t
    # Define evolution model
    evolve = models.AdiabaticEvolution(h0, h1, s, dt=1e-2)
    # Get the final state of the evolution
    final_state = evolve(final_time=T)


According to the adiabatic theorem, for proper scheduling and total evolution
time the ``final_state`` should approximate the ground state of the "hard"
Hamiltonian.

If the initial state is not specified, the ground state of the easy Hamiltonian
will be used, which is common for adiabatic evolution. A distributed execution
can be used by passing an ``accelerators`` dictionary during the initialization
of the ``AdiabaticEvolution`` model. In this case the default initial state is
|++...+> (full superposition in the computational basis).

Callbacks may also be used as in the previous example. An additional callback
(:class:`qibo.tensorflow.callbacks.Gap`) is available for calculating the
energies and the gap of the adiabatic evolution Hamiltonian. Its usage is
similar to other callbacks:

.. code-block::  python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import hamiltonians, models, callbacks

    nqubits = 4
    h0 = hamiltonians.X(nqubits)
    h1 = hamiltonians.TFIM(nqubits, h=0)

    ground = callbacks.Gap(mode=0)
    # define a callback for calculating the gap
    gap = callbacks.Gap()
    # define and execute the ``AdiabaticEvolution`` model
    evolution = models.AdiabaticEvolution(h0, h1, lambda t: t, dt=1e-1,
                                          callbacks=[gap, ground])
    final_state = evolution(final_time=1.0)
    # print the values of the gap at each evolution time step
    print(gap[:])


The scheduling function ``s`` should be a callable that accepts one (s(t)) or
two (s(t, p)) arguments. The first argument accepts values in [0, 1] and
corresponds to the ratio ``t / final_time`` during evolution. The second
optional argument is a vector of free parameters that can be optimized. The
function should, by definition, satisfy the properties s(0, p) = 0 and
s(1, p) = 1 for any p, otherwise errors will be raised.

All state evolution functionality described in the previous example can also be
used for simulating adiabatic evolution. The solver can be specified during the
initialization of the :class:`qibo.models.AdiabaticEvolution` model and a
Trotter decomposition may be used with the exponential solver. The Trotter
decomposition will be used automatically if ``h0`` and ``h1`` are defined
using as :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian` objects. For
pre-coded Hamiltonians this can be done simply as:

.. code-block::  python

    from qibo import hamiltonians, models

    nqubits = 4
    # Define ``TrotterHamiltonian``s
    h0 = hamiltonians.X(nqubits, trotter=True)
    h1 = hamiltonians.TFIM(nqubits, h=0, trotter=True)
    # Perform adiabatic evolution using the Trotter decomposition
    evolution = models.AdiabaticEvolution(h0, h1, lambda t: t, dt=1e-1)
    final_state = evolution(final_time=1.0)


When Trotter evolution is used, it is also possible to execute on multiple
devices by passing an ``accelerators`` dictionary in the creation of the
:class:`qibo.evolution.AdiabaticEvolution` model.

Note that ``h0`` and ``h1`` should have the same type, either both
:class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.Hamiltonian` or both
:class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian`.
When :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian` is used, then ``h0`` and
``h1`` should also have the same part structure, otherwise it will not be
possible to add them in order to create the total Hamiltonian. For more
information on this we refer to
:meth:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian.is_compatible`.
If the given Hamiltonians do not have the same part structure and ``h0``
consists of one-body terms only then Qibo will use an automatic algorithm
(:meth:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian.make_compatible`)
to rearrange the terms of ``h0`` so that it matches the part structure of ``h1``.
It is important to note that in some applications making ``h0`` and ``h1``
compatible manually may take better advantage of caching and lead to better
execution performance compared to using the automatic functionality.


Optimizing the scheduling function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The free parameters ``p`` of the scheduling function can be optimized using
the :meth:`qibo.evolution.AdiabaticEvolution.minimize` method. The parameters
are optimized so that the final state of the adiabatic evolution approximates
the ground state of the "hard" Hamiltonian. Optimization is similar to what is
described in the :ref:`How to write a VQE? <vqe-example>` example and can be
done as follows:

.. code-block::  python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import hamiltonians, models

    # Define Hamiltonians
    h0 = hamiltonians.X(3)
    h1 = hamiltonians.TFIM(3)
    # Define scheduling function with a free variational parameter ``p``
    sp = lambda t, p: (1 - p) * np.sqrt(t) + p * t
    # Define an evolution model with dt=1e-2
    evolution = models.AdiabaticEvolution(h0, h1, sp, dt=1e-2)
    # Find the optimal value for ``p`` starting from ``p = 0.5`` and ``T=1``.
    initial_guess = [0.5, 1]
    best, params = evolution.minimize(initial_guess, method="BFGS", options={'disp': True})
    print(best) # prints the best energy <H1> found from the final state
    print(params) # prints the optimal values for the parameters.

Note that the ``minimize`` method optimizes both the free parameters ``p`` of
the scheduling function as well as the total evolution time. The initial guess
for the total evolution time is the last value of the given ``initial_guess``
array. For a list of the available optimizers we refer to
:ref:`Optimizers <Optimizers>`.


.. _symbolicham-example:

How to define custom Hamiltonians using symbols?
------------------------------------------------

In order to use the VQE, QAOA and time evolution models in Qibo the user has to
define Hamiltonians based on :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.Hamiltonian`, or
:class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian` when the Trotter
decomposition is to be used. Qibo provides pre-coded Hamiltonians for some
common physics models, such as the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and the
Heisenberg model (see :ref:`Hamiltonians <Hamiltonians>` for a complete list
of the pre-coded models).
In order to explore other problems the user needs to define the Hamiltonian
objects from scratch.

A standard way to define Hamiltonians is through their full matrix
representation. For example the following code generates the TFIM Hamiltonian
with periodic boundary conditions for four qubits by constructing the
corresponding 16x16 matrix:

.. code-block::  python

    import numpy as np
    from qibo import hamiltonians, matrices

    # ZZ terms
    matrix = np.kron(np.kron(matrices.Z, matrices.Z), np.kron(matrices.I, matrices.I))
    matrix += np.kron(np.kron(matrices.I, matrices.Z), np.kron(matrices.Z, matrices.I))
    matrix += np.kron(np.kron(matrices.I, matrices.I), np.kron(matrices.Z, matrices.Z))
    matrix += np.kron(np.kron(matrices.Z, matrices.I), np.kron(matrices.I, matrices.Ζ))
    # X terms
    matrix += np.kron(np.kron(matrices.X, matrices.I), np.kron(matrices.I, matrices.I))
    matrix += np.kron(np.kron(matrices.I, matrices.X), np.kron(matrices.I, matrices.I))
    matrix += np.kron(np.kron(matrices.I, matrices.I), np.kron(matrices.X, matrices.Ι))
    matrix += np.kron(np.kron(matrices.I, matrices.I), np.kron(matrices.I, matrices.X))
    # Create Hamiltonian object
    ham = hamiltonians.Hamiltonian(4, matrix)


Although it is possible to generalize the above construction to arbitrary number
of qubits this procedure may be more complex for other Hamiltonians. Moreover
constructing the full matrix does not scale well with increasing the number of
qubits. This makes the use of :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian`
preferrable as the qubit number increases, as these Hamiltonians are not based
in the full matrix representation. On the other hand a
:class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian` is more complicated to
construct for an arbitrary Hamiltonian.

To simplify the construction of Hamiltonians, Qibo provides the
:meth:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.Hamiltonian.from_symbolic` and
:meth:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian.from_symbolic` methods which
allow the user to construct Hamiltonian objects by writing their symbolic
form using ``sympy`` symbols. For example, the TFIM on four qubits could be
constructed as:

.. code-block::  python

    import sympy
    import numpy as np
    from qibo import hamiltonians, matrices

    # Define symbols for X and Z operators
    Z = sympy.symbols("Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3")
    X = sympy.symbols("X0 X1 X2 X3")

    # Define Hamiltonian using these symbols
    # ZZ terms
    symbolic_ham = sum(Z[i] * Z[i + 1] for i in range(3))
    # periodic boundary condition term
    symbolic_ham += Z[0] * Z[-1]
    # X terms
    symbolic_ham += sum(X)

    # Define a map from symbols to actual matrices
    symbol_map = {s: (i, matrices.X) for i, s in enumerate(X)}
    symbol_map.update({s: (i, matrices.Z) for i, s in enumerate(Z)})

    # Define a dense Hamiltonian
    ham = hamiltonians.Hamiltonian.from_symbolic(symbolic_ham, symbol_map)
    # This Hamiltonian automatically constructs the full matrix which can be
    # accessed as ``ham.matrix``.

    # Define a more memory-friendly Trotter Hamiltonian
    trotter_ham = hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian.from_symbolic(symbolic_ham, symbol_map)


Defining Hamiltonians from symbols is usually a simple process as the symbolic
form is very close to the form of the Hamiltonian on paper. Note that in the
case of :class:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian`, Qibo handles
automatically the Trotter decomposition by splitting to the appropriate terms.

As noted in the :ref:`How to simulate adiabatic time evolution? <adevol-example>`,
when using Trotter decomposition to simulate adiabatic evolution, then ``h0``
and ``h1`` should be compatible in order to add them.
This is usually not true when constructing Hamiltonians using symbols.
However, if the constructed Hamiltonians are not compatible but ``h0`` consists
of one-body terms only (which is the case in most adiabatic evolution
applications) then Qibo will use an automatic algorithm
(:meth:`qibo.base.hamiltonians.TrotterHamiltonian.make_compatible`) to make it
compatible to ``h1``. We note that in some applications, making the Hamiltonians
compatible  manually instead of relying on the automatic functionality,
may take better advantage of caching compared and lead to better execution
performance.
